      <p>
        Becoming a physcian will endure as your all-time best investment<br>
        decision, and on behalf of your community, we're grateful for it. When<br>
        you choose to invest in Canvas, we'll ensure you list Canvas as<br>
        the second best investment you've ever made for your practice,<br>
        guaranteed. Contact us when you're ready to discuss the details.

    <div>
      <h1>1.</h1> <h3>Making the decision to switch</h3>
      <p>
        You should only move forward with Canvas if and when you have determined that<br>
        we far outperform other vendors and offer an unmatched return on investment. Our<br>
        goal is to give you as much information as possible to make this determination one<br>
        way or the other. We will provide access to a sandbox of the Canvas application for<br>
        you to get a feel for the platform as well as references to current customers to talk<br>
        about their experience.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h1>2.</h1> <h3>Interfaces and Community Integration</h3>
      <p>
        Canvas is meant to integrate with your existing interfaces and community<br>
        resources. At a minimum, this means porting over your fax number, enrolling your<br>
        payers with our clearinghouse, and getting bidirectional lab feeds running. We'll<br>
        also load your preferred specialists and imaging centers into Canvas so that<br>
        sending referrals and closing loops is seamless. Finally, if interfaces with health<br>
        information exchanges or other information technology vendors are important, we<br>
        will work with you to determine what we can deliver and when.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h1>3.</h1> <h3>Data Migration</h3>
      <p>
        The first thing we will do is gain access to a full backup of your current data, which<br>
        we have executed successfully with both remotely hosted and on-premise EMR<br>
        databases. Then our work begins to import into Canvas. Patient demographics and<br>
        information like medications, problems, and allergies is relatively straightforward.<br>
        While importing clinical notes and documents is more challenging, our team has<br>
        been able to do this at a high level of fidelity with a wide variety of EMRs.
      </p>
    </div>
      <div>
        <h1>4.</h1> <h3>Training and Site Visit</h3>
        <p>
        We will work with you to configure Canvas properly, including clinical content,<br>
        charge schedules, and much more. Role-based trainings will be done a few weeks<br>
        prior to go-live to familiarize relevant team members with clinical, practice<br>
        management, and billing workflows. Either before or during go-live, one of our<br>
        team can visit your practice to work side-by-side with you on implementation and<br>
        training.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h1>5.</h1> <h3>Go-Live and Tuning</h3>
        <p>
          Go-live is when you start using Canvas with real patients in your practice. We will be<br>
          with you, either in-person or remotely depending on your preference, to make sure<br>
          everything goes smoothly. There is always fine tuning to do once you have a<br>
          handful of encounters in Canvas under your belt: changing clinical microtemplates,<br>
          setting up new automations, modifying practice management settings, and more.<br>
          We are here to help with it all.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h1>6.</h1> <h3>Sustained Performance</h3>
        <p>
        All EMR contracts should contain assurances against broken promises and provide<br>
        support over the long term. Our Performance Warranty means that if we are not<br>
        meeting expectations, you can terminate the agreement and receive all payments<br>
        back. We do not expect this to happen). For our Standard plans, we also offer a<br>
        MIPS guarantee: if you receive a negative adjustment, we will cover it And for<br>
        everyone, we provide unlimited 24/7 support at no charge. We expect this to be a<br>
        long, productive partnership for us both.
