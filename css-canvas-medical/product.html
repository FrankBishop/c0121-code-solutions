          You don't have to click a dozen times to order a flu shot or<br>

          count. Canvas pulls everything you need directly into your<br>
          note, so you never have to leave it. And because Canvas<br>
          learns from every interaction, it gets smarter with every<br>
          patient you see.</p>
