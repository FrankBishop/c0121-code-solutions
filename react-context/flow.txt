-When the user clicks Register Now on the Home Page the auth-form component is re-rendered to show the registration forms, this rendering is
determined through conditional statements in the render method of the auth-form class

-the username and password entered are passed into this.state through the setState method.  Once the handleSubmit request is fired, a POST request is made
to the server.  If the user was signing up, the POST request is made for the route '/api/auth/sign-up' then the password is hashed then the username and password are
sent to the database.  Then the form changes to the sign-in page.

error.  If they do match the user can logon.
